# Kustomark Implementation Plan

## Status: M1 (MVP) Core Implementation Complete ✅

This document tracks the implementation of kustomark based on the spec milestones.

## M1: MVP - Local sources, core patches, CLI

### Priority Order

1. **[DONE] Project Setup & Foundation** ✅
   - ✅ Initialize TypeScript project with Bun
   - ✅ Setup project structure (core library, CLI)
   - ✅ Configure linting, testing, build
   - ⏳ Setup CI/CD basics (deferred)

2. **[DONE] Core Library - Config Parsing** ✅
   - ✅ Parse YAML config schema
   - ✅ Validate required fields (apiVersion, kind, output, resources)
   - ✅ Support glob patterns in resources
   - ✅ Support resource negation with `!`
   - ✅ Support recursive kustomark config loading
   - ✅ Implement onNoMatch handling (skip|warn|error)

3. **[DONE] Core Library - Resource Resolution** ✅
   - ✅ Resolve file globs to actual files
   - ✅ Resolve references to other kustomark configs
   - ✅ Build resource resolution tree (base → overlay → overlay)
   - ✅ Merge resources in order (last wins for conflicts)

4. **[DONE] Core Library - Patch Engine** ✅
   - ✅ Implement `replace` operation
   - ✅ Implement `replace-regex` operation with flags support
   - ✅ Implement `remove-section` operation with GitHub-style slug parsing
   - ✅ Implement `replace-section` operation
   - ✅ Implement `prepend-to-section` and `append-to-section` operations
   - ✅ Support patch filtering (include/exclude globs)
   - ✅ Support per-patch onNoMatch override

5. **[DONE] Core Library - Diff Generation** ✅
   - ✅ Generate unified diff format
   - ✅ Track which patches were applied
   - ✅ Track warnings (patches with no matches)

6. **[DONE] CLI Layer - Commands** ✅
   - ✅ Implement `kustomark build [path]` command
   - ✅ Implement `kustomark diff [path]` command
   - ✅ Implement `kustomark validate [path]` command
   - ✅ Handle exit codes (0=success, 1=error/changes)

7. **[DONE] CLI Layer - Output Formatting** ✅
   - ✅ Implement text output format (default)
   - ✅ Implement JSON output format (`--format=json`)
   - ✅ Support verbosity flags (`-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv`, `-q`)
   - ✅ Support `--clean` flag for build command

8. **[DONE] Testing** ✅
   - ✅ Unit tests for config parsing (154 tests pass)
   - ✅ Unit tests for patch operations
   - ✅ Unit tests for resource resolution
   - ✅ Unit tests for diff generation
   - ✅ Integration tests with fixtures
   - ✅ Test CLI exit codes
   - ✅ Test JSON output parsing
   - ✅ Test file comparison

9. **[TODO] Documentation** (Next priority)
   - ✅ CLI help text
   - ⏳ Basic README with examples
   - ⏳ API documentation for core library

## M2: Enhanced Operations (Future)
- Frontmatter operations
- Line operations
- Advanced validation

## M3: Remote Sources (Future)
- Git support
- HTTP support
- Caching
- Lock files

## M4: Developer Experience (Future)
- Watch mode
- Explain command
- Lint command
- Init command

## Current Focus

**M1 MVP Core Complete!** All 8 core implementation tasks are done. The CLI is fully functional with:
- Complete config parsing and validation
- Resource resolution with support for nested configs
- All patch operations (replace, regex, section operations)
- Diff generation
- All CLI commands (build, diff, validate)
- Comprehensive test coverage (154 tests passing)

**Next Steps:** Documentation improvements (README, API docs)
